You’re getting this error because your system is Ubuntu Noble (24.04), but you still have an old Kubernetes repo for Ubuntu Xenial (16.04) configured:

https://apt.kubernetes.io kubernetes-xenial Release
This repo no longer provides a Release file, so apt refuses to use it.

✅ How to Fix the Issue
Step 1 — Remove the old, broken Kubernetes repo
Run:




Shell
sudo rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
(or whatever file contains that xenial repo — you can list them using: ls /etc/apt/sources.list.d/)

Alternatively, edit it:




Shell
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
Remove the line:

deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
Save and exit.

Step 2 — Add the correct Kubernetes repo for your OS (Ubuntu 24.04 Noble)
Kubernetes now uses a new repo structure (containerd, CRI-O, K8s).

Use the official repo:




Shell
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
sudo curl -fsSL https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/Release.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-apt-keyring.gpg] https://pkgs.k8s.io/core:/stable:/v1.31/deb/ /" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list
Step 3 — Update apt again



Shell
sudo apt update

This time, no error should appear.

✔️ What Happened?
Your OS: Ubuntu Noble 24.04
Old repo: kubernetes-xenial (16.04) → no Release file → apt blocks it.

Removing the old repo fixes the problem immediately.

If you want, I can check your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ to confirm which file is causing the issue.









How do I verify the new repo is working?

What if I still see the same error?
