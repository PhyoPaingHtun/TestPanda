**You installed Bitnami Kafka in namespace kafka,
BUT Minikube is running “kafka-controller” pods from a different namespace.**
This explains EVERYTHING.

✔ Step 1 — Check where the “kafka-controller-*” pods are actually running
Please run:
Shellkubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kafkaShow more lines
You will see something like:
kafka-controller-0   xxx   <some-other-namespace>

Those pods are NOT in the namespace you think.
Most likely, the old Confluent resources are running in:

default
or kube-system
or an older namespace like kafka-new, kafka-2, etc.

This is why deleting the kafka namespace didn't remove them.

✔ Step 2 — Identify who is creating those pods
Run:
Shellkubectl describe pod kafka-controller-0 --namespace <THEIR_NAMESPACE>Show more lines
Inside the YAML, you will find the controller owner:
Controlled By:  StatefulSet/kafka-controller

OR
Controlled By:  Kafka/kafka-new


✔ Step 3 — Delete the Confluent deployment at the REAL namespace
Once we identify the correct namespace:
Delete the release:
Shellhelm uninstall <release-name> -n <namespace>Show more lines
Delete the namespace:
Shellkubectl delete namespace <namespace>Show more lines

🔥 Example: If the pods are in default
Then:
Shellhelm uninstall kafka-new -n defaultkubectl delete namespace defaultShow more lines
(Or only delete the resources, not the namespace if it's a core namespace.)

✔ Step 4 — Verify Bitnami Kafka is actually running now
After cleaning:
kubectl get pods -n kafka

Bitnami pods are:
kafka-0
kafka-1
kafka-2
zookeeper-0
zookeeper-1
zookeeper-2


🟩 Your next step — run this and send me the result
Please send:
Shellkubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep kafkaShow more lines
I will immediately tell you:

which namespace the wrong pods are in
which release is responsible
what exactly to delete

After that, your Bitnami Kafka will finally run correctly.
