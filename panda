FIX: Completely clean the namespace and remove Confluent CRDs
You must remove everything related to Confluent.

STEP 1 — Delete ALL Confluent pods
Shellkubectl delete pods --all -n kafkaShow more lines

STEP 2 — Delete ALL resources in the namespace
Shellkubectl delete all --all -n kafkaShow more lines

STEP 3 — Delete StatefulSets, CRDs, and leftover resources
Confluent Operator creates many objects. Remove them:
Delete CRDs
Shellkubectl get crds | grep confluent | awk '{print $1}' | xargs kubectl delete crdShow more lines
Delete StatefulSets
Shellkubectl delete statefulset --all -n kafkaShow more lines
Delete deployments
Shellkubectl delete deployment --all -n kafkaShow more lines
Delete jobs
Shellkubectl delete job --all -n kafkaShow more lines
Delete PVCs
Shellkubectl delete pvc --all -n kafkaShow more lines

STEP 4 — Delete the entire namespace (recommended)
Since this namespace is polluted by Confluent's operator:
Shellkubectl delete namespace kafka``Show more lines
Then re-create it:
Shellkubectl create namespace kafkaShow more lines

STEP 5 — NOW install Bitnami Kafka correctly
Shellhelm install kafka bitnami/kafka -n kafkaShow more lines

What Bitnami Kafka pods should look like
You should expect:
kafka-0
kafka-1
kafka-2
zookeeper-0
zookeeper-1
zookeeper-2

⚠️ NOT:
kafka-controller-0
kafka-controller-1
kafka-controller-2

Those are Confluent.

Please run this and send the output:
kubectl get crds | grep confluent

This will confirm which Confluent CRDs are still active and causing the unwanted controller pods.

I can guide you step-by-step once I see that output.
