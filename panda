You MUST delete the ENTIRE NAMESPACE to fix this
Everything else you tried cannot remove Confluent leftovers.
Run this:

✔ STEP 1 — Delete the whole namespace
Shellkubectl delete namespace kafkaShow more lines
Wait for it to fully disappear:
Shellkubectl get nsShow more lines
Only proceed when kafka is gone.

✔ STEP 2 — Recreate a CLEAN namespace
Shellkubectl create namespace kafkaShow more lines

✔ STEP 3 — Install Bitnami Kafka again
Shellhelm install kafka bitnami/kafka -n kafka``Show more lines

✔ STEP 4 — Check pods
Shellkubectl get pods -n kafkaShow more lines
Expected correct Bitnami result:
kafka-0
kafka-1
kafka-2
zookeeper-0
zookeeper-1
zookeeper-2

❌ NOT:
kafka-controller-0


❗ WHY namespace deletion is required
Because Confluent Operator created hidden resources that:

do NOT disappear with kubectl delete all
do NOT disappear with CRD deletion
keep recreating kafka-controller-* pods even without CRDs

Only deleting the namespace will remove:

Finalizers
Webhook configs
Mutating admission configs
Leftover CRs
Orphaned resources managed by CFK operator


👉 Please run this now:
kubectl delete namespace kafka

Then send me:
kubectl get ns

I’ll confirm when it's ready to reinstall Bitnami Kafka cleanly.
